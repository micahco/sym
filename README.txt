sym-0.0.2

IP got banned so I guess I'm done with this. Probably a good thing.
Gonna keep this repo here for future reference.

Notable notes:

* when running with a high pageLimit (>30), the page would stop responding.
Wasn't able to find a solution for this. Pretty sure WSL was running out of memory.

* would've been cool to run it with concurrent puppeteer pages, multiple windows
scraping data at once. Need to try it out on a dedicated unix machine.

* rateyourmusic.com is wasting its data.
